My name is Shabeer Khan. I do not have much qualities, rather de-qualifiers:

- I always like to drink beer but with cig...!
- I'm a kind of angry man... impressed by Daniel Lewis (There Will Be Blood)

Lets move forward, this section is much important.

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
