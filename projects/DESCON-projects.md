### [Hodor Mobile App](https://github.com/KI-labs/hodor_flutter_mobile)

Hodor is a an app that was developed to conveniently open the door of our building in Munich office by communicating with the Raspberry Pi. It is an improved version of the [Slack bot](https://github.com/KI-labs/Hodor) which was already developed by other team members. The main motivation behind doing this project was to get hands dirty with [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.io/) and try to build a cross-platform mobile app. 

The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/KI-labs/hodor_flutter_mobile) but unfortunately I won't be contributing to it anymore.
